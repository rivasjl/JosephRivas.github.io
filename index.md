The datasets that I will be using in my analysis come from our worldindata.org that tracks information about COVID 19 such as number of cases, deaths, vaccination count, etc...

[Datasets](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

Firstly, I will use SQL in order to manipulate the dataset in order to answer a few questions that can be made from looking at the dataset. 
These questions include:

  1. Which countries have the highest amount of deaths?
  2. Which countries have the highest death rate/vaccination rate?
  3. How has vaccination rates changed over time?

Some of the skills that I used in SQL are: Aggregate functions, CTEs, Joining Tablesand  Group/Sort By clause.

Next, I will use R and more specifically, the ggplot2 package in R to create visualizations that display the information that we are looking.
