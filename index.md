The datasets that I will be using in my analysis come from our worldindata.org that tracks information about COVID 19 such as number of cases, deaths, vaccination count, etc...

[Datasets](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

Firstly, I will use SQL in order to manipulate the dataset in order to answer multiple questions. 

Then, I will use Tableau to create a dashboard that is filled with visualizations of this dataset.
